## Step 2: credentials

### Cracking

We can get the ntlm hash for the passwords ([source](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Volatility/Retrieve-password)).

```

```518172d012f97d3a8fcc089615283940``` -> Rick's pwd

The lmhash is an empty string.

Could not crack it using [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) or [hashcat](https://cyberloginit.com/2017/12/26/hashcat-ntlm-brute-force.html).

cracking it does not seem to be possible

### LSA

"it seems more than likely that the hash, or password, will also be stored in memory. In fact, there are quite a few password crackers that take your password directly from memory." - [source](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/113298)

From ```volatility3 -h```:
```

```

Password: ```MortyIsReallyAnOtter```

Can be confirmed by hashing it with ntlm ([ntlm hash generator](https://codebeautify.org/ntlm-hash-generator)).

## Step 3: Local network

```
vol3 -f dump.vmem windows.netscan
```

(see netscan.txt)

Almost all the "LocalAddr" are either ```0.0.0.0```/```127.0.0.1``` (localhost) or ```192.168.202.131```.

Rick's IP: ```192.168.202.131```

## Step 4: internet

Did this step after step 7, so I already had the malware at this point.

Neither ```Rick And Morty season 1 download.exe``` and ```vmware-tray.exe``` appear in the netscan.

Ran malware with wireshark, did not notice any requests, including when it supposedly checks that the payment was received.

This is also confirmed by decompiling ```vmware-tray.exe``` where we can see:
```csharp
private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    MessageBox.Show("Checking Payment.................Please Wait", "Please wait");
    MessageBox.Show("Your Payment has failed, The funs have been sent back to your wallet. Please send it again", "Error");
}
```

## Step 5: The Process

We can see running processes with ```windows.pstree``` (see pstree.txt).

2 processes seem suspicious:
```
PID     PPID    ImageFileName   Offset(V)       Threads Handles SessionId       Wow64   CreateTime      ExitTime
* 3820  2728    Rick And Morty  0xfa801b486b30  4       185     1       True    2018-08-04 19:32:55.000000      N/A
** 3720 3820    vmware-tray.ex  0xfa801a4c5b30  8       147     1       True    2018-08-04 19:33:02.000000      N/A
```

We can see where the name of the binaries with ```windows.cmdline``` (see cmdline.txt).
```
PID Process Args
3820    Rick And Morty  "C:\Torrents\Rick And Morty season 1 download.exe" 
3720    vmware-tray.ex  "C:\Users\Rick\AppData\Local\Temp\RarSFX0\vmware-tray.exe" 
```

We get the file addresses with ```windows.filescan``` (see filescan.txt):
```
0x7e710070  \Torrents\Rick And Morty season 1 download.exe  216
0x7daad840  \Users\Rick\AppData\Local\Temp\RarSFX0\vmware-tray.exe  216
```

We can dump the files with ```windows.dumpfiles```:
```
$ vol3 -f dump.vmem windows.dumpfiles --physaddr 0x7e710070
Cache   FileObject      FileName        Result

DataSectionObject       0x7e710070      Rick And Morty season 1 download.exe    file.0x7e710070.0xfa801b5a8d10.DataSectionObject.Rick And Morty season 1 download.exe.dat
ImageSectionObject      0x7e710070      Rick And Morty season 1 download.exe    file.0x7e710070.0xfa801a79c860.ImageSectionObject.Rick And Morty season 1 download.exe.img
```
```
$ vol3 -f dump.vmem windows.dumpfiles --physaddr 0x7daad840
Cache   FileObject      FileName        Result

DataSectionObject       0x7daad840      vmware-tray.exe file.0x7daad840.0xfa801ab15890.DataSectionObject.vmware-tray.exe.dat
ImageSectionObject      0x7daad840      vmware-tray.exe file.0x7daad840.0xfa801b494c30.ImageSectionObject.vmware-tray.exe.img
```

No idea why it gives us 2 files for each binary (they aren't identical), some ideas:
- found it in 2 different places ?
- one of the format has more debugging info ?
- something to do with the fact it was running ?

It seems to come down to Windows internal stuff, which is pretty complicated üí©.

Going to ignore it for now and assume there is no real difference for our purposes.

We can get the processes memory with ```windows.memmap --pid 3820 --dump``` (the dumps are not on the git because they are too large).

## Step 6: The Malware

### Static analysis

There is a file on Rick's desktop called ```READ_IT.txt```, it reads:
```
Your files have been encrypted.
Read the Program for more information
read program for more information.
```

The malware seems to take a part of it's memory and unarchive it at runtime, it saves the result to a temp file and executes it.

The process runs under the name ```vmware-tray.ex``` (notice the ```.ex```).

Running strings on it shows these 2 strings:
```
Your Files are locked. They are locked because you downloaded something with this file in it.
```
```
This is Ransomware. It locks your files until you pay for them. Before you ask, Yes we will
give you your files back once you pay and our server confrim that you pay.
```

vmware-tray is a dotnet file and can be debugged with dnSpy.

Somethings are called "hidden-tear" in dnSpy, after searching "hidden-tear ransomware" on Google I found the [repo for the original ransomware](https://github.com/goliate/hidden-tear).

We can see that it starts by encrypting files using AES256 (CBC mode) with a randomly generated password.

It then asks for 0.16 bitcoin to be sent to ```1MmpEmebJkqXG8nQv4cjJSmxZQFVmFo63M``` to decrypt the files.

It doesn't actually check that the funds were received, and doesn't decrypt the files.

### Dynamic analysis

Ran the malware with wine, probably a bad idea but I was sick of staring at assembly ü§°.

![screenshot_1](malware1.png)
![screenshot_2](malware2.png)
![screenshot_3](malware3.png)

### Recap

When ran ```Rick And Morty season 1 download.exe``` will unpack and run ```wmware-tray.ex```, which was hidden inside the binary.

vmware-tray encrypts the users files.

vmware-tray asks to send bitcoin to ```1MmpEmebJkqXG8nQv4cjJSmxZQFVmFo63M```.

vmware-tray is a **ransomware**.

## Step 7: The Root Cause

The malware is called "Rick And Morty season 1 download.exe" and is located in the ```C:\Torrents\``` folder.

We can assume that Rick tried to download the first season of the show via BitTorrent (which it still running).

We can actually see other Rick and Morty episodes using ```vol3 -f dump.vmem windows.filescan``` (see filescan.txt):
```
0x7d6b3a10  \Torrents\Rick and Morty - Season 3 (2017) [1080p]\Rick.and.Morty.S03E07.The.Ricklantis.Mixup.1080p.Amazon.WEB-DL.x264-Rapta.mkv    216
0x7d7adb50  \Torrents\Rick and Morty - Season 3 (2017) [1080p]\Rick.and.Morty.S03E06.Rest.and.Ricklaxation.1080p.Amazon.WEB-DL.x264-Rapta.mkv   216
0x7e5f5d10  \Torrents\Rick and Morty Season 2 [WEBRIP] [1080p] [HEVC]\[pseudo] Rick and Morty S02E03 Auto Erotic Assimilation [1080p] [h.265].mkv   216
```

He expected the file to be a video so he double-clicked to open it but instead it ran as a program.

Did not find the 2 flags mentionned in the subject.

## Step 8: The key

Looking at the ransomware code we can see that the key is randomly generated and is too complex to bruteforce.

It is then passed to the ```SendPassword``` function:
```csharp
public void SendPassword(string password)
{
    string text = string.Concat(new string[]
    {
        this.computerName,
        "-",
        this.userName,
        " ",
        password
    });
}
```

It doesn't *actually* do anything but it can help us find the key in the memory dump since we know the compute name and username.
```
$ strings -e l pid.3720.dmp | grep WIN-LO6FAF3DTFE-Rick 
WIN-LO6FAF3DTFE-Rick aDOBofVYUNVnmp7
```
(Note: ```-e l``` changes the encoding to UTF-16LE, used by Windows)

key: ```aDOBofVYUNVnmp7```

## Step 9: The Best Rick Of Them All

**NOT FINISHED**

The file we are interested in is ```\Users\Rick\Desktop\Flag.txt```.

Tried to reproduce the exact same algo that the ransomware used (based on ```EncryptFile``` and ```AES_Encrypt```), but I haven't been able to make it work (yet).

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

class Program
{
    public static byte[] StringToByteArray(string hex)
    {
        return Enumerable.Range(0, hex.Length)
                         .Where(x => x % 2 == 0)
                         .Select(x => Convert.ToByte(hex.Substring(x, 2), 16))
                         .ToArray();
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        byte[] bytesToBeEncrypted = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("test");
        byte[] passwordBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("aDOBofVYUNVnmp7");
        passwordBytes = SHA256.Create().ComputeHash(passwordBytes);
        Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(passwordBytes).Replace("-", ""));

        byte[] result = null;
        byte[] array = new byte[]
        {
                1,
                2,
                3,
                4,
                5,
                6,
                7,
                8
        };

        using (MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
        {
            using (RijndaelManaged rijndaelManaged = new RijndaelManaged())
            {
                rijndaelManaged.KeySize = 256;
                rijndaelManaged.BlockSize = 128;
                Rfc2898DeriveBytes rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(passwordBytes, array, 1000);
                rijndaelManaged.Key = rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(rijndaelManaged.KeySize / 8);
                rijndaelManaged.IV = rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(rijndaelManaged.BlockSize / 8);
                rijndaelManaged.Mode = System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode.CBC;
                Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(rijndaelManaged.Key).Replace("-", ""));
                Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(rijndaelManaged.IV).Replace("-", ""));

                // using (CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(memoryStream, rijndaelManaged.CreateEncryptor(), System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStreamMode.Write))
                // {
                //     cryptoStream.Write(bytesToBeEncrypted, 0, bytesToBeEncrypted.Length);
                //     cryptoStream.Close();
                // }
                // result = memoryStream.ToArray();

                result = StringToByteArray("6ce17e8f1a200b42b97dd3f6fb1a0ec4");
                Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(result).Replace("-", ""));
                using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
                {
                    using (CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(ms, rijndaelManaged.CreateDecryptor(), System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStreamMode.Write))
                    {
                        cryptoStream.Write(result, 0, result.Length);
                        cryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock();
                        string decrypted = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(ms.ToArray());
                        Console.WriteLine(decrypted);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

I also tried to use the [hidden-tear-decrypter](https://github.com/goliate/hidden-tear/blob/7bdd6250c2c9ef0d2235698cfebe688b92598a54/hidden-tear-decrypter/hidden-tear-decrypter/Form1.cs#L41) I found on github, got the same result.
