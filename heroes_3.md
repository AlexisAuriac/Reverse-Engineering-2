```
The Heroes III: The Shadow of Death CD-ROM was not found! 

The Shadow of Death requires a CD for Single Scenario Games, Campaign Games, and hosting Multi-player Games.

If you wish to join a Multi-player Game hosted by another player, a CD is not required, and you may proceed. 

If you wish to play a Single Scenario or a Campaign, please quit and insert the The Shadow of Death CD, before re-running The Shadow of Death.

Make sure we can play everything, some part can be patched independently
